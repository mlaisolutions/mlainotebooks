    "An Azure ML Workspace is an Azure resource that organizes and coordinates the actions of many other Azure resources to assist in executing and sharing machine learning workflows.  In particular, an Azure ML Workspace coordinates storage, databases, and compute resources providing added functionality for machine learning experimentation, deployment, inference, and the monitoring of deployed models."

You can [create a new subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or access existing subscription information from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
